# recharge-pin-js-project

In this project, I created a recharge PIN system
using the the telecom service providers (MTN, Etisalat, Airtel, Glo) in y country Nigeria as case study
The system/program generates recharge pin based on user phone number and network (as the unique inpiut)
It will also check if PIN generated already exist in the list customers' database, then regenerate another pin authomatically
I used locastorage as my mini-databade/server here ...

On loading part of the recharge PIN, the system/program checks if the pin has already been loaded 
(the check is done authoatically looking through the customers' data-list already stored)
if PIN is not already used, the PIN can then be loaded by the user
